# Oleen Ohana

A Flutter project for the Brother Hackathon 2022. 

## Mini-Hackathon #4. 

Oleen (the “joyous”) runs a specialty tour on the island of Oahu. Her
mellifluous voice and excellent customer relationship skills earned her
referrals and repeat businesses. Her secret is to treat everyone like her
"ohana," or family. Her challenge is to keep track of her growing family and
always remember to send her customer a coconut-scented air freshener!

Can you help Oleen? She will show you the impasse to paradise!

# Brother Hackathon

Feel free to use any of my GitHub repositories in your apps. You should also consider
attending the free Brother Hackathon happening this year. You get a free Brother QL-1110NWB,
a PT-P910BT, and possibly an awesome DS-940DW mobile scanner. Visit brotherhackathon.com for
more information. I will be teaching workshops, and they are free. You can ask me any questions.
Thank you.
